I have read with great interest the paper  [*The Interactive Nature of Computing: Refuting the Strong Church–Turing Thesis*](#goldin-interactive) by Dina Goldin and Peter Wegner. 
The reading took me to my first years teaching computability.
At that time, I remember feeling uneasy while teaching the Fundamentals of Computability with questions (that I kept only to myself :smile:) like:

* *"What do operating systems compute?"*, 
* *"What does my word processor computes?"* 

This paper is an attempt to tackle questions like these by introducing a new type of computing model they  name *Persistent Turing Machines*. Let me quote a couple of paragraphs

> Function-based computation transforms a finite input into a finite output in a finite amount of time, in a closed-box fashion. By contrast, the general notion of computation includes arbitrary procedure and processes--which may be open, non-terminating, and involving multiple inputs interleaved with outputs.

> We believe it is time  to recognize that today's computing applications, such as web services, intelligent agents, operating systems, and graphical user interfaces, are *interactive* rather than *algorithmic*; their job is provide ongoing services over time

Summarizing, the conclusion of the paper is that the statement 

**A Turing Machine can do anything that a computer can do**

is **false**

## Problem: The Asynchronous Sum (ASP)

Write an Ordinary Turing machine that adds two numbers in unary.
The machine has three tapes:

1. The first is an input tape
2. The second is the tape for computing
3. The third will be used for output

The following considerations apply:

* Numbers (coded in unary) are'nt in the  input tape at the beginning of computation
* Instead, the ones and separators are entered in asynchronous/unknown times with an encoding like the one below to add 3 and 4

   ```
   111X1111X
   ``` 
   (3 ones, an `X` that acts as a separator, 4 ones and an `X`)
* The ones `1` and the` X` can be written at any time after the computation starts.
* Of course when they have not been written the cell contains a blank
* The rest of the tape is filled with white
* The machine in addition to being able to move its read/write heads to the left (`L`) and right (` R`) is endowed with a capacity of **NO** movement `S`

## Problem: The Infinite Case

Extend the previous Turing Machine so that once it finish the computation it keeps adding the asynchronously incoming numbers forever

## Problem: Driving home from work (DHFWP)

**Describe** (Only describe!) a Turing Machine that drives a car to home from work, where the locations of both work and home are provided as input parameters.

You can add as many input tapes (read only) as you want. 
* One for a detailed map, 
* another for the current weather report, 
* another for the images of the camera, 
* another for the information from the wheels, 
* etc.

As in the previous problem the information arrives asynchronously and the machine can keep the heads stationary.

The output tapes of of this problem should be two time series:

* One that shows the position of the wheel (e.g., in degrees from the vertical) during the drive, and 
* Another to show the pressure on the gas and break pedals during the drive.
