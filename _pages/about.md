## CV Summary 

Casiano Rodriguez-Leon obtained the degree in Mathematical Sciences in 1978. In 1987 he read the thesis and obtained the Doctor's Degree in Mathematics, having [Professor Miguel Sánchez García](https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/autor?codigo=244980) as PhD advisor. In his thesis contributions were made to the design and complexity analysis of optimization algorithms. During this period he participated as main researcher in projects financed by the Government of the Canary Islands and the University of La Laguna. Later he has carried out two research stays at the [EPCC - Edinburgh Parallel Computing Center](https://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/research), one at [East Stroudsburg University (USA)](https://www.esu.edu/), three as visiting professor at the [University of Valenciennes (France), now Polytechnic University of Hauts-de-France](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universit%C3%A9_polytechnique_des_Hauts-de-France) working with prof. [Rumen Andonov](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=N8kejj8AAAAJ&hl=es) and four as invited professor at  [Universidad Nacional de San Luis (Argentina)](http://www.unsl.edu.ar/) invited by [Prof. Raul Gallard](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Raul-Hector-Gallard-70648676). He contributed to the parallelization of algorithmic divide and conquer, dynamic programming and branch and bound techniques. These works lead to the PhD  theses of Felix García López, [Francisco Almeida Rodríguez](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=kWvhQTUAAAAJ&hl=es) and [Daniel González Morales](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Daniel-Gonzalez-Morales-70477196) and the subsequent published articles. He lead the ULL research team of the related coordinated projects TIC99-0754-C03-01 and [MaLLBa (TIC99-0754-C03-01)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226315228_MALLBA_A_Library_of_Skeletons_for_Combinatorial_Optimisation). His contributions in the field on Parallel Processing Languages produced a number of PHD thesis: [Coromoto León](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=L4AkM5MAAAAJ&hl=es) and [Francisco de Sande](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=giHnJE0AAAAJ&hl=es). Another line of research has been the study of computational complexity models and performance analysis for parallel processing. More precisely the Bulk Synchronous Parallel Model (BSP). This line beared to the thesis of Jose Luis Roda García (ULL) and [Marcela Printista (Universidad Nacional de San Luis, Argentina)](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=P0iSBhMAAAAJ&hl=es). His studies on the best topologies for parallel computing and nested parallelism resulted in the discovery of dynamic hypercubes structures that are suitable for nested computing and was the core of the PhD thesis of Fabiana Piccoli (Universidad Nacional de San Luis, Argentina). He was a [Perl hacker](https://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=626604) and his contributions to the Comprehensive Perl Archive CPAN are well known. Among them is [Eyapp](https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/Parse-Eyapp/eyapp#COPYRIGHT), a [nested LR parser](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220117739_Solving_Difficult_LR_Parsing_Conflicts_by_Postponing_Them) that produced several articles on the subject. 

He has participated in several national projects lead by Prof. Coromoto León, like [TRACER (TIC2002-04498- C05-05)](http://www.ia.urjc.es/jspTIN2004/informes/TIC2002-04498-C05.pdf) which addresses the study of efficient and flexible algorithmic techniques that allow users to focus solely on the problem they wish to solve, avoiding having to enter areas other than their domain. The coordinated project "Optimization and network environment" - OPLINK (TIN2005-08818-C04-04), the main objective is to improve the results of communication problems. In MSTAR (TIN2008-06491-C04-02) the possibility of undertaking the resolution of a problem directly as a multi-objective is introduced. The agglutination of the resolution of multiple optimization problems with parallel techniques and their possible generalization has been the main objective of the TOP project (TIN2011-25448).  In the TOMAS (TIN2016-78410-R) project meta-heuristic optimization techniques were applied to the planning of dietary menus. He has also leaded several projects for the acquisition of infrastructure that conducted to the fundation of the ULL service for Supercomputing (https://www.ull.es/servicios/segai/servicios/saii/). 

He has directed hundreds of [bachelor degree final projects](https://riull.ull.es/xmlui/discover),  tens of Master thesis,  and seven [doctoral theses](https://dialnet.unirioja.es/buscar/documentos?querysDismax.DOCUMENTAL_TODO=casiano%20rodriguez%20leon&filtros.DOCUMENTAL_FACET_ENTIDAD=tes). One of them has received the extraordinary doctorate prize in Science of the ULL. At this stage of his research, he has published more than twenty articles in journals and more than fifty documents in the proceedings of international conferences. In the transfer section see the many contributions in CPAN,  the software tools developed as a result of several  projects like MaLLBa, METCO and SCHOOLTHY;  all distributed under a GNU public license. He is an advocate of GitHub Education Technologies and has several related articles and works on Computer Science Education.
